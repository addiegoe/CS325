# portfolio project for CS325


Instructions for running program:
1) Can be run remotely on github pages at: https://addiegoe.github.io/CS325/index.html

2) Can be run locally on Mac or Windows environment by downloading files and opening index.html in Google Chrome.

3) To play, type in guesses in the input fields and click the "check my guess" button. Your guess will appear along with a clue; after that, you can enter another guess, up to 8 guesses. The solution will appear onscreen when the game is over, either because the user has guessed the solution or because eight turns are up.

Note: to view the program's solution (for testing purposes), open Chrome's JS console; the solution is written to the console on page load.
